/**
 *  Represents a card table with a deck and an array of open cards for the game of Set.
 */

/*
Tips:
- The largest number of cards that don't have a "set" is 20.  There is no
need ever to have more than 21 cards open.  The default number of open cards is 12.
- Keep open cards in an array.  Although open cards are displayed on a two-dimensional
grid, this is a matter for the display class to handle.  Here it is easier to use a
one-dimensional array.
- The open cards array may have gaps: if a card is missing, the corresponding element is
set to null.
- Don't forget to shuffle the deck after it has been created.
- Note that getOpenCard(i) must check that i is within bounds and return null
if it isn't.
- open3Cards places each card into the first available slot.
- In the toString method, separate strings for individual cards with "\n".
- compactCards fills the gaps among the first dfltOpenCards cards with
the cards available beyond the first dfltOpenCards.  A simple algorithm to
accomplish that is similar to the partitioning algorithm:
 * Start at both ends of the array.
 * Proceed for as long as the left index is less than dfltOpenCards and
the right index is greater or equal dfltOpenCards.
 * If you find a card on the left, increment the left index.
 * If you find a gap on the right, decrement the right index.
 * If you find a gap on the left and a card on the right, fill the gap
with that card and advance both indices.
